# CS 255 Module Eight Journal – DriverPass Portfolio

## Project Summary
The client for this project was DriverPass, a company that wanted a web-based system to help students prepare for their driving exams. The system was designed to allow students to purchase training packages, schedule driving lessons, and take online practice tests. It also supports staff roles such as secretaries, instructors, and administrators, each with different permissions and responsibilities.

## What I Did Well
One area I did particularly well was translating the client interview into clear system requirements and UML diagrams. I focused on identifying the main user roles and making sure the system design reflected real-world workflows, such as lesson scheduling, progress tracking, and practice testing.

## What I Would Improve
If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the level of detail and consistency in the UML diagrams. I would add clearer validation rules, such as handling scheduling conflicts and payment confirmations, and simplify some diagram layouts to improve readability.

## Interpreting User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing the interview transcript and identifying both functional and nonfunctional requirements. Considering user needs is important because a system must support how users actually work. Ignoring these needs can result in a system that is confusing, inefficient, or difficult to maintain.

## My Software Design Approach
When designing software, I start by gathering requirements and identifying key stakeholders. I then use techniques such as use cases, UML diagrams, and iterative review to refine the system design. In the future, I plan to continue using these strategies to ensure systems are well-structured, user-focused, and maintainable.
